    <p>Free will is the freedom for a person to choose between different courses of actions and is given to every human being. So, the fact that these three movies, The
    Truman Show, Bandersnatch, and Free Guy go beyond the norms of having their free will taken away from them was the most interesting thing to me while I watched them. Each of these
   movies, different with their approaches but all have the same main theme: free will & false worlds. I wanted to dedicate a fanpage to these amazing films, the thought behind them, and the
 intricate process of creating them. A lot of people don't even realize how The Truman Show inspired reality TV shows which are now very popular, or how Bandersnatch was groundbreaking in the
 interactive movie making process. Nonetheless, all of these films deserve to be appreciated, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
